# low-cost-solar-powered-USV
This repository contains the work done for my masters thesis at OsloMet. The thesis is about the design and construction of a low cost, solar powered USV, build to monitor water quality.

The vessel consist of a Stand-Up-Paddle board, and carries an aluminium frame that has two Blue Robotics T200 thrusters connected to it. In addition, two pelican cases are mounted to the frame which houses all hardware. The hardware makes use of ArduPilot, an autopilot, by using a Pixhawk 4, GPS module, and Herelink- ground station and air unit. The frame is designed to be highly modular and can be folded in to a case such that the entire USV is easy to transport and deploy. For measuring water quality, the USV makes use of a pH-, DO-, temperature-, and conductivity probe, purchased from Atlas Scientific. All probes are controlled by a seperate Raspberry Pi Model 4b.

The USV should be operated at 30% throttle and can, with the help of two solar panels, operate for roughly three hours, depening on sun light and other conditions.

This resporitory contains all 3D models used to design the USV and the complete assembly (Solidworks). In addition, technical drawings, as well as videos and the probe setup are to be found.
